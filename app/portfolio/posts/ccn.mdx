### Background

Campus Climate Network (CCN) is the leading hub of the climate justice movement on college campuses across America. CCN provides student organizations the resources, skills, and network to run winning campaigns on campuses.

After graduating from NYU, I wanted to continue to support the student climate movement despite no longer being a student. CCN gave me an incredible opportunity to do just that. I joined them in the role of a Key Advisor in August of 2023. In this role, I help advise student organizations on their campaigns, specifically fossil fuel divestment campaigns. I also have been a student mentor for individual students, supporting them wherever I can.

In addition to working with student organizations, I built and maintain their [website](https://www.campusclimatenetwork.org).
