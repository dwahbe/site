### Background

I helped start the Sunrise Movement chapter at NYU in 2020. After a semester of recruitment, building a base, and creating some internal structure, we collectively decided to push NYU to divest from fossil fuels. This wasn't a new campaign at NYU, multiple generations of student organizers have pushed NYU to divest from the fossil fuel industry.

When we began our campaign, we reached out to these previous organizers to connect with them, learn from their mistakes and wins, and see where we could pick up from. While these previous campaigns didn't get NYU to divest, they laid the foundation for us. Students mobilized to get NYU to establish a Sustainability Office, made this a key issue amongst the student body, and engaged with faculty and staff to win wide-support. If it wasn't for these efforts, our campaign wouldn't have been able to be successful.
