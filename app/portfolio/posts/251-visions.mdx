### Background

In 2020 a family friend needed help with her website. I didn't know anything about web deisgn and development, but it was the start of lockdown and I was trying to find new things to do. She is an amazing photographer, so luckily, the photos spoke for themselves.

Shortly after publishing her site, I realized lots of small businesses struggled with building their websites. Professional agencies were often too expensive for them so they typically resorted to mocking something up themselves. After building a few more sites for different small bussiness and freelancers I knew, I could turn this into a business. I didn't know where it would go but figured I could make some money, learn a lot, and help people in my community.

When deciding on a name I needed something that was memorable, unique, and to be honest, had great SEO results. I decided on 251 Visions, 251 (ii-V-i) is one of the foundational chord progressions in jazz. The 2 chord is minor, the 5 dominant or suspenseful, and 1 is the resolution. Essentially, a player goes from melancholy to suspense to beautiful resolution. The idea was I could take your exsisitng website, from something hard to read and inaccessible, to a nice resolution, ultimately bringing your _vision_ to life.

While fun, the name didn't have quite the memorablity I thought it would, and as a universal rule of life, most people don't like jazz. C'est la vie.

Nevertheless, I continued 251 Visions throughout my time at NYU. Between 2020 and 2023, I had over 20 clients, including therapists, a music school, a salon, a few professors, labor unions, and multiple nonprofits. I also began to help my clients with email campaigns, social media, and other marketing. By 2022, I was being hired by larger companies as a contractor. I would work with their in-house marketing team to design and build their site. This was the first time I was designing websites in a team, which taught me a lot about collaboration.

When I started at [Hack Club](dwahbe.com/portfolio/hackclub) in 2023, I began to wind down 251 Visions. I am very grateful to all my clients who trusted me to build their sites, esspcially the one's at the beginning when I had no portfolio. And to this day, I still help friends and family build their sites, most recently, a simple site for my [brother's wedding](https://www.ianandjohanna.com).
