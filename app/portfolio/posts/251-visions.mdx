### Background

After helping a family friend with her website, I realized lots of small businesses struggled with branding and building their online presence. Professional agencies were often too expensive for them so they typically resorted to mocking something up themselves. This almost always resorted in inaccessible, hard to read, and seldom responsive sites.

After building a few more sites for family friends, I decided to turn a hobby into a freelance business. When deciding on a name I needed something that was memorable, unique, and to be honest, had great SEO results. I decided on 251 Visions. 251 (ii-V-i) is one of the foundational chord progressions in jazz. The 2 chord is minor, the 5 dominant or suspenseful, and 1 is the resolution. Essentially, a player goes from melancholy to suspense to resolution. The idea was I could take your exsisitng website, from something hard to read and inaccessible, to a nice resolution, ultimately bringing your _vision_ to life.

While fun, the name didn't have quite the memorablity I thought it would, and as a universal rule of life, most people don't like jazz. C'est la vie.

Between 2020 and 2023, I had over 20 clients, including therapists, a music school, a salon, a few professors, labor unions, and multiple nonprofits. I also began to help my clients with email campaigns, social media, and other marketing work.

When I joined [Hack Club](/portfolio/hackclub) in 2023, I began to wind down 251 Visions. I am grateful to all my clients who trusted me to build their sites, especially the ones at the beginning when I had no portfolio. And to this day, I still help friends and family build their sites, most recently, a simple site for my [brother's wedding](https://www.ianandjohanna.com).
