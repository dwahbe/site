### About

Despite being one of the defining challenges of our time, coverage of the climate crisis and its solutions are overshadowed by the outrage cycle and misinformation. Climate River equips its audience with the latest and most credible news on the crisis. This is done by aggregating articles from leading outlets, improving headlines for accuracy, and ranking for trust and timeliness.

Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Postgres. [Code available on GitHub](https://github.com/dwahbe/climate-river). Inspired by [Techmeme](https://techmeme.com).
