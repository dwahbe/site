### About

Despite being one of the defining crises of our time, the climate crisis is often overshadowed by political maneuvering and the outrage cycle. Climate River brings focus to the latest climate news by aggregating articles from leading outlets, organizing by story, and ranking for trust and timeliness. Inspired by [Techmeme](https://techmeme.com).

Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Postgres. [Code available on GitHub](https://github.com/dwahbe/climate-river).
