### About

Despite being a defining crisis of our time, the climate crisis often gets buried in the feed. Climate River brings it back to the top by aggregating articles from leading outlets, organizing by story, and ranking for trust and timeliness. Inspired by Techmeme.

Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Postgres. [Code available on GitHub](https://github.com/dwahbe/climate-river).
